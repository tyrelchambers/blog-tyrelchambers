I'm Tyrel Chambers and I'm a Software Enginner, Customer Success hybrid. I love building projects I find exciting regardless of their utility. I love taking photographs and going for drives in the snow. There's a lot to me that makes me, me and most of my time is trying to figure out what that is, exactly. I hope you enjoy the writings I have here and that you find something that resonates with you. If you'd like to see some of my work, head over my [portfolio](https://tyrelchambers.com) to see some of my projects there.
